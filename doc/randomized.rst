Randomized Designs
================================================================================

In this section, the following kinds of *randomized designs* will 
be described:

- Latin-Hypercube
- Random K-Means
- Random Uniform

.. hint::
   All available designs can be accessed after a simple import statement::

    >>> from pyDOE3 import *
    
.. index:: Latin-Hypercube

.. _latin_hypercube:

Latin-Hypercube (``lhs``)
=========================

.. image:: _static/lhs.png

Latin-hypercube designs can be created using the following simple syntax::

    >>> lhs(n, [samples, criterion, iterations])

where 

* **n**: an integer that designates the number of factors (required)
* **samples**: an integer that designates the number of sample points to 
  generate for each factor (default: n)
* **criterion**: a string that tells ``lhs`` how to sample the points
  (default: None, which simply randomizes the points within the intervals):
  
  - "center" or "c": center the points within the sampling intervals
  - "maximin" or "m": maximize the minimum distance between points, but
    place the point in a randomized location within its interval
  - "centermaximin" or "cm": same as "maximin", but centered within the
    intervals
  - "correlation" or "corr": minimize the maximum correlation coefficient
  - "lhsmu" : Latin hypercube with multifimensional Uniformity. Correlation between
     variable can be enforced by setting a valid correlation matrix. Description of the
     algorithm can be found in `Deutsch and Deutsch`_.
  
The output design scales all the variable ranges from zero to one which
can then be transformed as the user wishes (like to a specific statistical
distribution using the `scipy.stats.distributions`_ ``ppf`` (inverse
cumulative distribution) function. An example of this is :ref:`shown below
<statistical_distribution_usage>`.

For example, if I wanted to transform the uniform distribution of 8 samples
to a normal distribution (mean=0, standard deviation=1), I would do 
something like::

    >>> from scipy.stats.distributions import norm
    >>> lhd = lhs(2, samples=5)
    >>> lhd = norm(loc=0, scale=1).ppf(lhd)  # this applies to both factors here

Graphically, each transformation would look like the following, going 
from the blue sampled points (from using ``lhs``) to the green
sampled points that are normally distributed:

Examples
--------

A basic 4-factor latin-hypercube design::

    >>> lhs(4, criterion='center')
    array([[ 0.875,  0.625,  0.875,  0.125],
           [ 0.375,  0.125,  0.375,  0.375],
           [ 0.625,  0.375,  0.125,  0.625],
           [ 0.125,  0.875,  0.625,  0.875]])

Let's say we want more samples, like 10::

    >>> lhs(4, samples=10, criterion='center')
    array([[ 0.05,  0.05,  0.15,  0.15],
           [ 0.55,  0.85,  0.95,  0.75],
           [ 0.25,  0.25,  0.45,  0.25],
           [ 0.45,  0.35,  0.75,  0.45],
           [ 0.75,  0.55,  0.25,  0.55],
           [ 0.95,  0.45,  0.35,  0.05],
           [ 0.35,  0.95,  0.05,  0.65],
           [ 0.15,  0.65,  0.55,  0.35],
           [ 0.85,  0.75,  0.85,  0.85],
           [ 0.65,  0.15,  0.65,  0.95]])

Customizing with Statistical Distributions
------------------------------------------

Now, let's say we want to transform these designs to be normally
distributed with means = [1, 2, 3, 4] and standard deviations = [0.1,
0.5, 1, 0.25]::

    >>> design = lhs(4, samples=10)
    >>> from scipy.stats.distributions import norm
    >>> means = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> stdvs = [0.1, 0.5, 1, 0.25]
    >>> for i in xrange(4):
    ...     design[:, i] = norm(loc=means[i], scale=stdvs[i]).ppf(design[:, i])
    ...
    >>> design
    array([[ 0.84947986,  2.16716215,  2.81669487,  3.96369414],
           [ 1.15820413,  1.62692745,  2.28145071,  4.25062028],
           [ 0.99159933,  2.6444164 ,  2.14908071,  3.45706066],
           [ 1.02627463,  1.8568382 ,  3.8172492 ,  4.16756309],
           [ 1.07459909,  2.30561153,  4.09567327,  4.3881782 ],
           [ 0.896079  ,  2.0233295 ,  1.54235909,  3.81888286],
           [ 1.00415   ,  2.4246118 ,  3.3500082 ,  4.07788558],
           [ 0.91999246,  1.50179698,  2.70669743,  3.7826346 ],
           [ 0.97030478,  1.99322045,  3.178122  ,  4.04955409],
           [ 1.12124679,  1.22454846,  4.52414072,  3.8707982 ]])
    
.. note::
   Methods for "space-filling" designs and "orthogonal" designs are in 
   the works, so stay tuned! However, simply increasing the samples 
   reduces the need for these anyway.

.. index:: Random K-Means

.. _random_k_means:

Random K-Means (``random_k_means``)
===================================

Random K-Means generates cluster centers using MacQueen's K-Means algorithm. 
This method creates well-distributed points in the unit hypercube by iteratively 
updating cluster centers based on randomly sampled points.

Random K-Means designs can be created using the following syntax::

    >>> random_k_means(num_points, dimension, [num_steps, initial_points, callback, random_state])

where 

* **num_points**: an integer that designates the number of cluster centers to generate (required)
* **dimension**: an integer that designates the dimensionality of the space (required)
* **num_steps**: an integer that designates the number of iterations (default: 100 * num_points)
* **initial_points**: an array of initial cluster centers (default: None, which uses random points)
* **callback**: a callable function called at each step with current cluster centers (default: None)
* **random_state**: an integer seed for reproducibility (default: None)

The output design contains cluster centers that are well-distributed across the 
unit hypercube [0, 1]^dimension.

Examples
--------

A basic 3-point, 2-dimensional Random K-Means design::

    >>> random_k_means(3, 2, random_state=42)
    array([[0.50047407, 0.49860013],
           [0.50168345, 0.50033893],
           [0.49956536, 0.50004765]])

With custom initial points::

    >>> initial = [[0.1, 0.1], [0.5, 0.5], [0.9, 0.9]]
    >>> random_k_means(3, 2, initial_points=initial, num_steps=50, random_state=42)
    array([[0.24854237, 0.25041155],
           [0.50043582, 0.50058412],
           [0.75123745, 0.74896743]])

.. index:: Random Uniform

.. _random_uniform:

Random Uniform (``random_uniform``)
===================================

Random Uniform generates random samples from a uniform distribution over the 
half-open interval [0, 1). This is a simple wrapper around ``numpy.random.rand`` 
that provides a consistent interface with other pyDOE3 functions.

Random Uniform designs can be created using the following syntax::

    >>> random_uniform(num_points, dimension)

where 

* **num_points**: an integer that designates the number of random points to generate (required)
* **dimension**: an integer that designates the dimensionality of each point (required)

The output design contains completely random points uniformly distributed in 
the unit hypercube [0, 1)^dimension.

Examples
--------

A basic 5-point, 3-dimensional Random Uniform design::

    >>> np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility
    >>> random_uniform(5, 3)
    array([[0.37454012, 0.95071431, 0.73199394],
           [0.59865848, 0.15601864, 0.15599452], 
           [0.05808361, 0.86617615, 0.60111501],
           [0.70807258, 0.02058449, 0.96990985],
           [0.83244264, 0.21233911, 0.18182497]])

For 2D visualization::

    >>> np.random.seed(123)
    >>> points = random_uniform(20, 2)
    >>> # Points are completely random with no structure
